    "The field of AI is becoming more and more popular everyday. This is, in part, thanks to the capabilities of generative AI models such as ChatGPT (for language), Stable Diffusion (for images), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are already familiar with prompt engineering in the case of language models such as ChatGPT. You might have noticed that language models like ChatGPT require a structured description of what you want from it. You can use chain-of-thought methods along with few-shot examples to align your language model instance with what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image models are slightly different because they are not trained on the same data as language models. Image models are primarily trained on captioned images, so the models pay more attention to keywords rather than elaborate descriptions."
