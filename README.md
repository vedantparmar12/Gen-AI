# Gen-AI

- Smithery is a platform to help developers find and ship agentic services. An agentic service is a server designed to communicate with language model agents. All our listed services follow the Model Context Protocols (MCP) specification. Our mission is to make agentic services accessible and accelerate the development of agentic AI. Smithery addresses this challenge by providing:
A centralized hub for discovering MCP servers
Hosting and distribution for MCP servers
Standardized interfaces for tool integration and configs

- An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process.
